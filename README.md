**Description**
BookSwap is a platform where users exchange books. Users create profiles listing books they own and seek. 
The system matches users with desired books, allowing them to contact owners directly to arrange swaps.

**Features**

1. User Authentication & Profiles
Users can create accounts and log in using their email or username. Each user has a profile where
they can provide personal details, including their name, profile picture, location, and preferred book genres. 
2. Book Management
Users can list books they want to trade by providing information such as the title, author, genre,
condition, and uploading photos. They can search for books or browse existing listings. Each book has
a dedicated page that displays detailed information about the book, the owner's details and so on.
3. Swap & Trade Functionality
Users can initiate a trade by requesting a book from another user. They can also propose a book from
their own collection in exchange when making the trade request. A system tracks the status of each swap,
helping users stay updated on the progress of their trades.
